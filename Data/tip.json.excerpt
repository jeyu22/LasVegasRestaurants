Packcake was nice and buttery tho. We sat at the breakfast bar because it was a shorter wait, while it's cool to watch them cook, the smoke from cooking just kinda gets to you after a while. I guess I would still give it another try, next time, I am going to sit at the table, and have either the pankcake or waffle. Two stars for now...","date":"2014-03-20 01:02:28","compliment_count":0}
