Super yummy I think my all time favorite was the spicy it has small cubes of jalape√±os on top of some spicy mayo. I also ordered the grilled squid and of course they're karage (chicken). Really yummy for soft opening I believe they are coming out pretty strong. I believe there is always room for improvement I know making takoyaki isn't easy but that's what soft openings are for right? To get to perfection! I would defiantly recommend this place it's super close to Japanese street food for a restaurant in America!

We were a bit lucky and snagged seats at the bar area. While sitting at the bar, you're able to see everything that the kitchen is doing. So if you're ever curious on whether or not they spit on your food....you won't have to be curious anymore!

We decided to share an order of their mentaiko takoyaki, original yakisoba, and an okonomiyaki. 

For their takoyaki, all of them are the same. The only difference is the sauce or topping they put on them. As we were sitting at the bar, we got to see how the takoyaki was made. The person making it probably was not used to it at all -- he was making them way too slow. Once he was done, he put all of them to the side grill while making more. Except a lot of them became quite deflated. 

Taste wise, it was decent with the sauce. But they did not serve the takoyaki fresh. Ours were sitting there for quite some time before they served it to us. I think he also cooked it too long that the octopus shrank too much. I can't say I was too impressed with this.

The yakisoba was pretty decent. The noodles were a really good texture. However, I think their sauce isn't quite as traditional? Their yakisoba sauce is missing something as it tastes different than what I'm used to.

Their okonomiyaki is thick and rectangular shaped versus the traditional circular shape. The flavor is pretty decent but I think they kind of overcooked this. They top it off with the same yakisoba sauce but they didn't put much sauce on it. Would have been better with more sauce so you could have a little bit of sauce on every bite. I think they did take our suggestion to heart and now there's more sauce!

Overall, pretty decent. Really fair pricing. However, it takes a while to get your food. And that just translates to ... if there's a wait, you'll be waiting for a while. I'd be willing to return if they could get the process of making takoyaki down :)",2018-10-03 04:09:41

We ordered the original takoyaki, 4 piece sampler, Japanese pancake, kimchi, and potato swirl. The takoyaki and the pancake were perfect! Nothing was overcooked and the veggies and seafood ratio was on point. I think my fave was the original, it is just a classic. One important point is to be careful of the inside of the takoyaki, it is super hot. 

I did not like the potato swirl. I am pretty sure it is supposed to be crunchy, but it was crunchy on the edges and soggy in the middle. I'd like it to be consistent in texture. The garlic flavor was good though!

Another problem was that we had to remind the waitress twice to get our kimchi. I was about to remind her a third time, but we made eye contact and she went immediately back into the kitchen to get the kimchi.

Soft openings are designed to practice and test out everything, therefore, this review is purely for soft opening period only

This is a new sister restaurant of Izakaya Go's, in main Chinatown, that serves Japanese street foods. Takopa is located in the middle, to the left of Mother's Korean BBQ, where it used to be an Asian DVD/CD store.

The size of Takopa is fairly decent, with an open style kitchen with large windows and 'bar seating"" so you can see everything being made. 

The menu is fairly simple. 4 takoyaki's, 3 yakisoba's, okonomiyaki, ramen, a small list of finger foods, and desserts. 

I came here with a few friends and we had the choice of sitting at the foldable white table in front of the restaurant or at the bar. There was an open 6-person table but it was said to be reserved (later saw a party of like 10-12 bringing cases of alcohol for a celebration). 

We had sat at the bar on the far right with views of the entire kitchen, mainly the takoyaki maker and the flat top for okonomiyaki/yakisoba. 

The takoyaki base is all the same. With octopus, green onion, and red ginger but 4 different ""styles"" varying in toppings and sauces. Since that was the case, we had opt'ed for the ""Mentaiko"" takoyaki to try. We were watching the takoyaki's being made. The chef working the takoyaki station was super slow. I even saw him lower the heat to match the speed of how he prepared the takoyaki. After pouring the very thin batter into the maker, he adds the red ginger, green onions, 1 piece of octopus, some sort of brown powder, and some sort of white powder to the maker, before he starts to flip everything with chopsticks. Due to the lowered heat, the outside of the takoyaki doesn't get enough color or ""crust"" if you can call it that. In my mind, a takoyaki should have a nice brown outside, while the inside is piping hot, nice and creamy. 

The restaurant was ""busy"" but not completely packed. After one batch was ""made"", it was put off to the other side to wait for orders while a new batch is made. The new batch was done but for some reason, we were given the ""older"" batch, while we saw he also picked from the newer batch for another order. All takoyaki received, were quite deflated and not piping hot. Typically, fresh made takoyaki, you can not put it in your mouth without breathing fire. I threw the entire thing in my mouth and was fine. As mentioned before, the base for the takoyaki is same throughout the 4 styles. ""Mentaiko"" has a thin drizzle of the mentaiko mayo and a small pile of shredded seaweed. The flavor of the takoyaki itself seemed nice. Hope after this soft opening period, the maker will be much faster and using a higher heat to make the takoyaki's nice and brown, and not deflated. Just watching him make the takoyaki was depressing enough. 

""Okonomiyaki (Japanese Pan Cake) - pork, shrimp, squid, cabbage, green onion, red ginger, dried bonito, seaweed powder, egg, homemade sauce and mayo w/ additional toppings (at extra cost) of cheese, jalapeno, kimchi, shredded seaweed, mentai mayo, or ontama. 

This is one thing i haven't had in ages and was excited to try again. Seeing so many japan video's by many various bloggers, i've been wanting to have okonomiyaki for a while. Loaded with a mountain of cabbage mixed with pork, shrimp, squid and red ginger again. Awkwardly they make it a rectangular shape and not a traditional round shape, stating it was easier for the chef to prepare this way. It takes an unbelievably long time, probably due to the thickness, to make an order. The egg they put in the beginning is way overcooked. 

My friend and I were discussing how this could be improved. We do believe more sauce is needed. Especially on how thick the okonomiyaki is. We observed the kitchen staff to brush on the brown sauce while drizzling a thin string of the white. Personally, we believe more of both would be beneficial. Typically im not a sauce guy, but in this case, it may be better? Or maybe offer some on the side for people to put more if wanted. Flattening it out a bit and probably covering each one would help the cook times, and maybe cook the egg separately to put on top? 

""Original Yakisoba"" w/ pork or chicken, cabbage, onion, green onion, red ginger, dried bonito, seaweed powder (option for a sunny side egg for additional cost). 

Last but not least, the yakisoba. Noodles cooked in hot water for a specific time before throwing on the flat top to cook with the other ingredients. Later I saw the chef to use 1 ladle amount. Maybe increase by 50%-100%? Flavor is ALMOST there. Though prefer the noodles to be a little less cooked as well. Overall, not bad. 

Discussed if hiroshima style okonomiyaki will be available and was told it is considered and may be implemented with future additions to menu

one major complaint though... WHY IS THERE GINGER IN EVERYTHING?! AND CAN WE OMIT IT?! (sad face) LOL",2018-09-24 16:46:53

That being said, this was a fun experience. I ordered three things to get a broad experience. The potato cut up on a stick was tasty and enjoyable. Definitely worth getting. The takoyaki sampler had one that I liked, two I was ok with, and one I wasn't so wild anout. The yakisoba is a bit of an acquired taste for me--smoke and salt were the dominant flavors that I tasted. Admittedly I'm not so sure I would be rushing to get it again but if those flavors work for you, then you're going to dig it.

Bonus points for an open kitchen. Really dug watching them prepare the food.

The ikamaru was cooked perfectly and had just a bit of seasoning. A must try for any squid lovers. My all time favorite though was the tako wasabi. The flavor was unlike anything I had tried before, the wasabi was not super spicy at all and the octopus was very fresh & tasty. I didn't care as much for the takoyaki, but I think it's just a texture thing for me. I assumed they'd be a bit more crispy, but were kind of mushy.

My friend and I ordered the original and mentaiko takoyaki. Both of the actual takoyaki just tasted flavorless and uninspired. The toppings could only do so much and I had to heavily rely on the pickled ginger to enhance the taste of the dishes. Very much not a good sign. 

The dish that I actually enjoyed was the okonomiyaki. It almost tasted like the ones I had in Japan. However, there is room for improvement.

But, maybe takoyaki in this case should be left for street vendors in Japan. 

We tried the 16-piece sampler, which included the original, mentaiko, spicy, and negi shio. Unfortunately, none of them really stood out too much and we all felt that the batter was undercooked. Both the seafood and original yakisoba were too salty for my liking. The sauce was not good. The okonomiyaki and ramen were average at best. I was also disappointed by how the potato tornado was overfried. It tasted exactly like potato chips on a stick and were brittle and broke right off instead of being crispy on the edges and slightly softer on the inside from the ones I've tried at night markets and street vendors. 

The only dish that I thought was done well was the karaage, which was well-fried and tender on the inside. Hopefully things improve after the soft opening.

The takoyaki was probably the most disappointing item on the menu as it was all mush on the inside. I was really mainly looking for a spot that served takoyaki and I was VERY disappointed.. The yakisoba on the other hand had a very odd sweet flavor to it while the noodles leaving a burnt after taste. The okonomiyaki was the most normal dish out of my order and was mediocre at best although some sauce tuning on the mentaiko should be made to attune to the dish better. The kurobuta sausage was also very bland and kind of resembled a semi fancier vienna sausage even though I personally believe even a vienna sausage would taste better. The garlic potato tornado chip was good.

I preferred the negi but found that the balls were oddly inconsistent with the texture/cook despite watching the chef make them all in one large batch. The bowl was a good value but served far too salty for my liking, while the tornado potato was just right: crispy edges, soft interior, light sprinkle of garlic.

I absolutely love the concept of the restaurant. The menu items are primarily small bites, but there's also the option of different yakisoba and ramen. Due to the fact that the prices are reasonable and a majority of the food choices are tapas, it's easy to try a variety of items. From the finger foods category, we ordered the tornado potato (fried potatoes on a skewer). We opted to go with a garlic powder topping. My boyfriend and I both ordered a different type of takoyaki - he ordered the mentaiko (spicy cod roe) and I ordered the spicy. The mentaiko is definitely not for someone who doesn't like ""fishier"" tastes; however, we really enjoyed both. There's a large glass window that wraps around the restaurant and you can watch the chefs freshly make the takoyaki! Super cool. The last thing we ordered was the okonomiyaki - a Japanese pan cake. It's customizable so we removed the pork and added kim chi. They do make you aware upon ordering that it takes about 20 minutes for the takoyaki and okonomiyaki to come out. The servers were very sweet and attentive. We'll definitely come back!",2018-10-16 02:05:30

Situated in the corner of a large strip mall on Fort Apache, I was across the street for a lash appointment and decided to make a pit stop at Hobby Lobby. Felt parched and walked into Pop thinking it was a bubble tea joint, nope definitely not that - as the name implies it's pop for my midwesterners. Not just any old pop, speciality drinks made with pop. 

Such a simple concept honestly, but very well thought out and executed. I'm not much of a pop drinker, after all I counsel against it. But every once in a while I'll give myself the option, luckily it's not something I crave. Initially it was the feeling that I had walked into the place assuming it was something else but felt odd walking out. I got to looking at the menu and looking back outside at the sun beaming down and thought I'd give it a whirl. Have to say, I will be back!

Soda is used as a base ingredient to craft a drink. So if you create your own you choose a size, pick your soda (or tea for my healthies), pick your add ins. I appreciate that they have an XS size which for me was truly a S. Great for portion control people! Then they have a menu with fool proof recipes created for us. I chose the Jojo because I enjoy Dr. Pepper and substituted the coconut cream for vanilla cream. Yum! They also have a secret menu (see picture - white) of drink creations and needless to say I was overwhelmed with options. Finally, they have a foods fo pair alongside your beverages, popcorn and cookies. A kids menu per say - an XXS drink (12 oz) with kid size popcorn. Also, got beverages, coffee/hot chocolate. 

Aside from my beverage being delicious, I appreciated the service. It's a very simple concept so to speak, so the fact that the employee took his time to talk me through the menu was above and beyond. The pricing was right! The shop has ample seating, parking. You get a stamp card for return visits. I wasn't told explicitly about a guarantee but I'm sure my drink would've been remade had I not liked it. 

I was told they have another location, Silverado Ranch. Will most definitely be going back and recommending on a hot, hot day!",2018-05-08 15:54:54

I rarely drink soda, so I am not even remotely in Pop's target audience. But I can appreciate their refreshing beverages when the temps hit triple digits in the desert!

The Oasis was my first drink of choice, which was fruity and not overly sweet despite the Sprite base.

The cookie is a tiny bit floury, but I enjoyed it. The chocolate chip cookie is not like any other I have had. I'm not even sure that they use brown sugar. It tasted more like a sugar cookie, but it was great. I enjoyed it. I wish they used that base with mini m&m's instead of chocolate chips. My chocolate loving companion felt the cookie needed more chips. 

For a soda fountain like concept, I appreciate all the soda options they have (particularly, the diet options, since I don't drink regular). I wish they had some handcrafted or local options. Otherwise, I can get most of the options elsewhere.

It's fun to try and is pretty tasty, I opted for the red rock. But now let's move onto the grand slam, the cookies. In Utah there's a very famous soda shop called Swig, that has these pink sugar cookies that are world famous. This place basically has replica swig cookies. They're super soft and served cold. They're jam packed with at least 5 cups of sugar and the most amazing frosting. They're the best. Overall, it's a soda shop with 17 year olds running it.

I appreciate that it is a drive thru and I can be there and gone within minutes.
There is always a friendly voice on the other end of the drive through speaker that is happy to suggest something tasty. 
Butterbeer is my favorite pop thus far... as well as the iced sugar cookies. I'm sure I'll visit again soon, and look forward to trying other treats. 
The menu has hundreds of possibilities I'm sure! With several soda flavors, several syrups, and other fun add ins. As well as energy drinks and teas that can be customized to your liking.
On occasion of I have driven through on a weekend evening I have also noticed a food truck that will stop by and open up shop.

It was going to be a 4 star review because of the prices but then I had the food and the cocktails and came to my senses.  Now, I didn't come here during happy hour or for a steak (which is a mistake I will not make next time) but I did come here for cocktails and ended up deciding on some delectable appetizers.  

Let's start with the decor.  It is dark.  It has subway tiles.  It is black and white.  It has pictures of celebrities dressed as admirals adorning the walls!  The decor is on point for sure and is quite spacious.  The bartenders are their pros as is customary in Nectaly's joints.  They served me both a sidecar (one of my favorite cocktails, and a porn star martini (one of their featured cocktails).  The sidecar was pretty good, not the best I've had but good.  The porn star martini was awesome and came with a side of bubbles.  As soon as I saw that it had passion fruit in it I had to order it.  You definitely tasted it in the drink and to my surprise, a fresh half passion fruit floated on top.  I've never had passion fruit fresh and let me tell you what, I was almost licking the inside of it it was so good.

When it comes to the food, my last sentence about licking reigns true here as well.  We got the hot wings and the pork belly mac and cheese.  Both were insanely good and something I could easily eat every day of my life if I wanted to die a very young man.  Both are incredibly decadent and flavorful and are both examples of top three wings and mac and cheese that I have ever had, possibly top two!  For a heavenly experience, get both and then drip the excess wing sauce on the mac and cheese.  You will feel like you died and went to heaven.  

I WILL be back for their steaks on happy hour I can assure you that.  This place kicks ass.",2018-11-13 00:28:54

Four of us ordered the XXL ribeye and two of us got the filet. The steaks were perfectly cooked. For sides, the Mac & cheese & risotto were awesome. We weren't huge fans of the brussel sprouts; we expected them to be crispy, but they weren't, and they had too much garlic. I was disappointed that bread & butter costs extra. Although I didn't drink alcoholic, my friends did & the bartender did an excellent job as well. I'd definitely return there during happy hour hours; if you do decide to go, be sure to make a reservation because the restaurant is small and people seem to stay forever (without a care that others are hungry too).",2018-10-27 21:53:47

I have another new favorite steak house! Herbs and Rye had been my long standing favorite but this place is equally awesome and it's on my way home from work! Definitely seems like a larger venue but same great quality vibe. My boss ordered the filet and corn and I of course ordered the ribeye (with a blue cheese rub) and garlic mash. Both steaks came out exactly as ordered. We also ordered brussel sprouts to share. I think its my fault for not realizing we ordered ""Street"" corn because I didn't realize it is tossed with cotija cheese. We explained to the server that my boss can't eat cheese and I don't eat corn but he was happy to bring out a spinach as substitute. The spinach and Brussels Sprouts were both ok but to be fair I wasn't really interested in them. My steak was amazing and the garlic mashed potatoes were perfect. I would also highly recommend the malbec.
It was easy to make a reservation as well as everyone was extremely friendly. Parking could be an issue although both this restaurant and others in the complex appeared busy and we easily found a parking space.

They All of my expectations for quality and service were met! I ordered the Ribeye, and a side of Cauliflower Au Gratin. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, and tasted great. The Cauliflower was also very good, and went well with my steak. Our table ordered a few sides, so I was able to try some of the others. The Bourbon Shallot Potatoes are probably the better potato side dish to order with your steak. The Sweet corn, and the Pancetta Collard Greens are also solid Side dishes. The interior of the restaurant is interesting, but still nice. 

I think it's natural to compare this restaurant with Herbs & Rye. If I had to choose, I would say that Herbs edges Cleaver a little bit, because of price. The happy hours are similar, but if I remember correctly, Herbs gives a free side with a steak order. Cleaver does not. Also, I believe Cleaver is slightly more expensive, in general.

It shares a parking lot with several other restaurants so be prepared for possible parking difficulties if you come in a weekend after 6.  

Love the vibe...very dark, swanky and romantic, but I felt the music was in conflict with the vibe and was a bit loud. The art was great!

Food was all incredible!  We ordered the steak tartare appetizer and OMG it was awesome. I would go back just for that.  We both got Ribeyes cooked to perfection, and the black garlic butter I added made it that much juicier.  We also tried the mushroom risotto which was excellent, and the street corn, which was so flavorful we couldn't stop eating it. 

The service was top notch...stellar....out of this world!  Our waiters were perfect in every way, and we never had to ask for a thing. I think this was the best water service I've ever had at any restaurant.  They are serious about keeping your glasses full!

It was around 1:30am when we arrived we greeted quickly and given a table quickly the decor was very nice inside and of course the cool pics they have hanging around!!!! 

Just like herbs and rye happy hour after midnight till close it's still 50 percent off on steaks and a few other items 

I wanted to start with oysters so I was very disappointed when they guy returns and says they are out and have no more :( I guess they didn't buy enough since they are new and trying to get a hang on things don't want to over purchase... so I decided to get the bone marrow instead.... for my main I decided to do filet mignon medium rare .... my friend got the NY strip.... we got the Mac and cheese and the elote corn ... for my drink I did basic vodka soda it's usually all I drink lol 

The bone marrow came out and I was excited I recently started eating this and enjoy it very much..... it has some sweetness from the berries but it was so yummy the berries give it that something special 

Next the steaks.... my filet was cooked perfectly they nicely cut it up for us so we could share..... I loved my steak and my friend loved mine to my friends NY strip was kinda dry though I was a little disappointed but oh well ... the Mac and cheese was good nothing to me super special but the corn I loved it

I think their sister property is beautiful and have good steaks so had high expectations of this restaurant.
I'd like to end on a good note so I'll start with the Cons...
We ordered the bone marrow (I paired it with the Scotch, honey, cream cocktail) and both were good. We found it odd that it didn't come with a spoon or a spreading knife to efficiently eat it with.
We then ordered the Squid Ink Pasta, Filet Mignon (Bearnaise sauce and peppercorn) with a side of Pork Belly Mac n Cheese. A big disappointment was that it all got cold fast bc it didn't come out hot in the first place. The Bearnaise sauce was a little too runny.
The server was great but noticed we wouldn't see him for a while. It turned out he was also serving the room by the bar (short staffed so soon?)
Another thing that I noticed was that the menu as much as I liked it, some of the sentences on the Prohibition history seemed to be incomplete.

Pros:
Upon walking in the ambience is beautiful with nice chandeliers, dark lighting, and elegant decor (with a twist of fun).
Blood Orange Oyster shooters were the best I've ever had. Delicious! A must try!
Happy hour is the same as Herbs and Rye which is a great one (half off steaks).
Great history on bartending and cocktails on the menu.

I will try to come back again and hope the best for this place. I really liked the concept and the beautiful ambiance. Here are some pics...",2018-09-14 18:52:17

We ordered half the menu and we'll be back soon to order the other half. The seafood platter was perfect, the oysters were super fresh and the crab legs blew me away. Somehow we managed to polish it off and still have room for the steaks, which were amazing, as expected. I had high expectations and they were exceeded. The whole restaurant is beautiful, the bar staff is fantastic, and the food is on point. I'm writing this review from the forklift they used to roll me out on. Extra points for being thoughtful enough to have one on hand for such purposes.

IMPORTANT: You must try the calamari as an appetizer and do not be intimidated by the number of options you have when it comes to customizing your steak. Order several and mix and match. The foie gras butter and ancho chile lime both deserve a try.",2018-09-11 05:58:18

I visited this restaurant based on the great opening reviews.

The Pork Belly Mac and Cheese was not what I expected. I expected to have the meat mixed into the macaroni not laid on top. The flavors didn't really mix to me as the macaroni was super cheesy and plain however, the Pork Belly was super salty.

The Parmesan Crusted Ribeye came with a Balsamic Sauce across it. The pieces of steak that had the sauce and/or cheese were fantastic! The pieces that didn't were bland. The meat lacked basic seasoning. I wanted salt but didn't want to ask for it as there is non on the table. I'm a basic (salt, pepper, garlic) steak eater. I don't think it takes much to make a good quality piece of meat taste good so, if it's bland to me.... it's bland!

The service was decent. I arrived and was promptly seated. My food arrive quickly. However, once I was done, I sat for awhile waiting for someone to ask if I was finished... maybe they didn't cause 80% of my food is still on the plate. 

4-stars because it wasn't horribly bad... They've only been open for 3 days (but keep in mind that they're a chain) ... if this place was opened longer, I would've given them only 2stars!",2018-09-13 01:56:07

Then I opted for an oyster shooter, vodka, tomato-y, sweet, yet smooth, no bite! 

For food, cause a girl's gotta eat and my man was starving, we started with the bone marrow, two large bones seared to perfection served with a berry demi glaze and some micro greens and a type of sliced radish or turnip, it was sticky good, sweet, tart perfection.

Then the main, I had the the Kansas City. It's a 16 oz with bone in. I got it medium, it was pink with seared edges. Lovely and fatty just how I like it. Nate had the filet medium rare, it was perfection. For sides we had the bourbon potatoes and the asparagus. Both were great complements.

Took my parents here for their anniversary and we were also celebrating my brother's birthday. We ordered the squid ink pasta and mussels which were really good. Also we got the mac & cheese, spinach, and corn as the sides to our 60 oz XXL steak. The bread wasn't as great as it was at Herbs but hey that's ok. The downfall was the steak itself. We were all so excited to dive in to something that massive when it was brought to the table, especially my mom who was telling my siblings (first timers) that Herbs made one of the best steaks she ever ate. Ordered a charred medium rare and got more of a medium well. I thought it was the lighting but it wasn't juicy so I told our server. He took it back to the kitchen and confirmed with us that it was over cooked so they were going to remake us another one which was fine. But after 10 min with sides on the table getting cold and hungry levels going down, the steak when it was brought out wasn't as appetizing anymore. We were pretty over it at that point and probably only ate less than a quarter of the steak between the five of us. I understand that mistakes are made in the kitchen bc I work in the same industry here in Vegas as well. But the experience overall just sucked. We were asked if we wanted dessert. We got a creme br√ªl√©e. It was brought out with no happy birthday or happy anniversary. I'm sure it wasn't a big deal for the celebrants but it would've been nice to feel somewhat special. I'm not sure why the hostess, when making a reservation, even asked if you're celebrating anything special if nothing extra is being done. Not even a free dessert at the very least for the experience we had. As much as I wanted to love this place there was nothing done by the server or manager at the very end to give us hope again. I get we came here for happy hour prices but even with that it wasn't worth it. In the end it just sucks getting the disappointed faces from my parents who came to celebrate a really special day for them and saying we should've gone somewhere else. I really hope they fix things here because we will not be returning or recommending this place otherwise.",2018-09-30 07:42:11

There are two reasons I didn't give this place a full five stars. One of the reasons is that it's a little bit pricier than Seafood City or Ranch 99 in the middle of town. The other reason is that it is smaller than Seafood City or Ranch 99.

One of the things that I love about this place is that it's on the Southeast side of town closer to where I live. This place is great for people who live in Henderson because we finally have a fairly large Market to shop at 4 Asian and Filipino foods. This place is just a little bit pricier than Seafood City but if you live in Henderson and don't feel like driving to the middle of town then this is a great place to go. It's also a little bit smaller but they seem to carry all of the basics.

The restaurant that they have inside is also really good. Because of the amount of traffic that seems to go through there the food seems to always be fairly fresh. I tried the Sisig, beef steak and BBQ Chicken skewer. The food was great. Although the Sisig was made a bit differently than what I'm used to it was still very good and full of flavor. I would definitely go back to try other dishes.

The one thing I was really surprised with the huge selection of ice cream. So many different flavors of ice cream like mango, Ube, Green Tea and Coconut. Next time I go I'm getting the Halo Halo ice cream.

Some of the veggies don't look fresh anymore. 

Also, random observation ... The workers are dressed in regular clothes (some even looked like they were about to hangout with their friends) so they almost look like they're just shopping and being nice that's why they're restocking the wall. Other places make you wear a uniform or at least an apron or a name tag or something where you can clearly distinguish that they work there in case you have to ask a question.

-Their produce quality is . They seem to keep their produce past their shelf life as in, green veggies are more brown than they are green and are still on the shelves to be purchased.

-Their ""fresh"" seafood section is not appealing (compared to seafood city HENDERSON).

-I went to IP on 9/25 to check out their blue crab and this isn't the first time, but the blue crabs were just in a brown box. probably the box it shipped in, i have no clue.  It was not refrigerated, not kept on ice, in water, nothing. Just take a group of blue crabs and put it in a box and thats what you'll see.  During this visit, about 90% of the crabs were dead with legs broken off.  A couple even had smashed shells.  Now I'm no expert but I highly doubt dead crabs should be kept with live crabs...to top it off the little ""water"" or whatever it was at the bottom of the box was brown...

-I went back to IP 9/26 to pick up a packet of spice i needed and decided to check if they got a new shipment of blue crabs...NOPE! They sure didn't!  The SAME box that was there the day before was still there. Dead crabs, smashed crabs, same.

-Their ""fresh fish"" section isn't properly iced entirely as ive seen at other asian stores and does not look like it's being kept at its required temperatures.

-Plus side, I haven't encountered any rude staff members.  Cashiers are always nice, staff at the restaurant are always nice.

After having an amazing lunch next door at the Lucky Thai, experimentation and intrigue grasped my interest at all of the sorts of wonderful foods they sell inside. Only slightly educated about the Philippines eating styles such as the rice infusion with most dishes the amazing spices that are used make their food choices. They practice a more healthier diet than Americans. The fusion of all their spices is so electric with all that zing when the fork goes into your mouth and touches your tongue it's a celebration of the marriage of all those spices. 

This market is very well organized that has very friendly staff. I was so impressed with the level of effort put out by the staff to help the guest here. They will help you out to the car and even load your groceries, for free. One will not see this at the large stores such as Kroger or Walmart. Not even Whole Foods does this for their customers.

While I was meandering around I visited the fruits and veggie section and discovered something new called Jackfruit. I did buy some of the Jackfruit in the rough and some already cut up. After consulting Google for what this fruit is and it's properties I took the leap and tried it. It is so good and tasted fantastic in a fruit salad that I made at home. I found coconut and mangos here as well that were perfect. The new coconut milk that I bought was very delicious with a pleasant taste too. 

During the check out process this went very smooth with the cashier smiling at me. I do not understand their native tongue but the cashier was having a conversation as I checked out with the cashier next to her.

Only thing is, it's not that great. Let me explain why. 

Before, we would drive the 20+ minutes to Seafood City to buy the Asian necessities not found at regular grocery stores. Here at Island Pacific, I can still buy most of the Asian items I need, that are SEALED. Things like a 25 lb bag of jasmine rice, soy sauce, spices, chips, you get where I'm going. These things I know are sealed and have a longer shelf life. 

The meat and vegetables on the other hand, are pretty sketch. On numerous visits, majority of the produce was sad. All of it looked old and was wilted. The ginger even had flies around it. If that's how they keep their vegetables, I can only imagine what their meat is like. No thanks!! 

Other cons I have about this place.. The aisles are tiny!! I know us Asians are small people, but come on. And if a worker is stocking a shelf with their inventory in the aisle, good luck trying to get in. And one last thing, who the hell designed this place???? The cash registers block the entrance to the actual store so I'm forced to enter through this tiny gap or walk all the way around toward the restaurant to actually get inside. And it doesn't help that customers are inconsiderate and have no sense of direction or space. Don't get me started on the cashiers. They are slow and not that friendly. I've only had one cashier that was friendly and quick. I wish I remembered his name, but good job to you, guy!! 

They do offer a rewards card, so you're able to save a bit of $ if you join. There is also a tiny Goldilocks to get your baked goods and a restaurant (Philhouse) to enjoy some grub. 

Will I continue to shop here? Yes because rice goes quick at our house. But I'll still drive further to get the rest of my Asian produce.",2017-08-21 06:24:27

I was there on Saturday. This is my second time here, first time here I went to food court only. There were 2 check out counter, 1 cashier was busy checking out a customer so I went to the other one with a male cashier. No customer in front of him and he was just scribbling, I unloaded my groceries from shopping cart, he didn't make eye contact, greet me or acknowledge me and before I finished unloading he walked away. Once I finished, I looked around and saw him on produce section talking to a customer. I did not wait for another minute, I walked away and left everything. That was the worst customer service I ever experienced, I never felt so invisible.

Will I go back to shop there? I don't think so. There are other Asian stores in the area, so I have options where I want to spend my money at. 

I will be back to food court only, their food is decent and people behind the counter are helpful and friendly.",2017-03-21 16:07:44

I had come in for some oyster sauce, but also found fresh mushroom, green onion and other ingredients that I needed. Their produce section was packed with fresh items. The prices were very reasonable as well.

We got in line for our purchases, and our cashier and bagger were so efficient that as soon as the person ahead of us was done paying, our order had already been bagged and rung up. They were not messing around! FAST!!!

I live around Silverado Ranch area and was in dire need of noodles. I came across this market seeing it was new and the closest to me, no more than a 5minute drive. I wasn't feeling well and figured the some of the Asian noodles (Chinese or Japanese) I've typically bought before would be available and be on my way.

I stepped in and boy was it small. I believe there were 5 aisles at most. I made my way (downtown walkin' fast faces past and I'm home bound dun dun dun dun) over to the noodle aisle and like some of the reviews had mention, a lot of it were Filipino products, not a bad thing just something I'm unfamiliar with so it was difficult finding something I've previously eaten in the past. I was able to find a Japanese product (a=singular=one lol) and purchased that, Less than $4-$5 and on my way I went.

I wasn't about to trust my perceptions from that one ""rescue"" visit, as a cup of lukewarm water would have been ambrosia after the potato incident.  But, it did prompt me to return and get a true feel for the place.

I have availed myself of this location's wares at least six times since then.  The staff is always pleasant, the tea (always black iced tea, no sweetener) has always been good (except for one bobble where I was served tea somehow mixed with coffee; in my usual quest for full disclosure in these reviews, I will note that the Great Bearded Bird detests the taste of coffee; that one I passed off to the Orchid.  ""Plus"" points for staff offering a replacement when Orchid brought it to their attention.)  (Hey, everybody deserves a mistake once in a great while; I was willing to forgive once.)

Friendly folks, quality product (at least according to my taste-buds), and as relaxing an atmosphere as you can get smack-dab in the middle of a busy shopping mall ... I will be back.

They offer suggestions if someone can't decide on which delicious drink they want.

Iced mocha-rich, smooth and oh so delish. 

Cherry almond muffin-full of cherries and almonds!! Not just a few here and there in the muffin. Super moist and such a decent size!!

Winters dream tea latte (during the cold season)- tastes somewhat like a milk tea with a little but of cinnamon. So good!!!

For this trip, I ordered the $10.95 Spam and eggs breakfast meal, and with it came seawood soup, two kinds of kim chi, sliced hot dogs, and a curious vegetable dish coated with mayonnaise. 

You need only know that the food was made with absolute care, thought, and love. The middle-aged gentleman who took my order appeared to not look very Korean but dutifully carried out the continuous, foreign marching orders barked out by the nice Korean lady who split half her time in the restaurant stand and the other half with a table full of customers who were potentially chatting about this weirdo at the next table over, snapping photos of his lunch from various angles while leaving this here review.

The side dishes came out first and were crisp and flavorful. Standard Korean fare but at least here one can be assured that none are recycled--dishes are returned to a communal dish-return stand shared by the entire food court. The eggs were a perfect over easy, the Spam hot and crisp, and the rice poofed into a pleasantly fluffy cloud of carby goodness that offset perfectly the salinity of the meat.

While I can perhaps vaguely understand that Spam is not a universal favorite, the blessed union between yolk and short-grain rice here is undeniably, universally awe-inspiring and is akin to having the sensation of slow, sensual love-making in one's mouth. Mix with the provided kim-chi for an extra kick, if desired.",2018-02-26 23:55:24

SPICY SQUID!! 

Now run to this place and order it. Nothing else, because it comes with 4 banchan, and a bowl of rice. You'll be full, I guarantee. 

Let me elaborate about this particular dish.
Pretty simple, first of all. 
It's squid, cooked in Korean spicy sauce, which I'm sure mixture of gochujang and something else. That's it.
The highlight of the dish is, the texture. 
I know a lot of people may stay away from squid because of its texture. But that's because when cooked wrong, it's just rubbery and chewy but you can never really bite it off or into small pieces so you don't know when to swallow?
Not at Island Style. Their squid was cooked perfectly, so while it's still bouncy, it has bite to it, and you can bite it off. It's a really fun, pleasant mouth feel, and you can't stop eating!!

4 banchan includes macaroni salad, napa kimchi, radish kimchi, and silver noodle tossed in creamy dressing. All of them offered different taste, flavor and texture, and well balanced.

The man at the counter was so kind. Not only he offered a bottle of water for my child sleeping in my stroller, he offered to bring  my plate to my table (it's a food court and I was ready to walk with this plate on my one hand and push stroller with the other. Things I do for food when I'm hungry.....lol).

I'm definitely going back, and would recommend this place to anyone!!",2018-08-20 18:51:18

They also do a thing where they have 50% off their juices that are going to expire that day. There was their ginger shots on sale before expiring as well and she let us chase them with the nut milk blend.

I tried apple cream pie and mudslide and those were both delicious! Super flavorful and sweet while being all natural.

I can't wait to come back and try their smoothies as well as have another ""fireball"" shot, so good for inflammation with turmeric, orange, cayenne, and black pepper.

Wow, what a nice welcome! Forget feeling guilty asking for more samples, I was happily surprised I could try every single one without feeling bad. Thank you for doing this for your customers. It works, I was hooked right away. 

So far, my favorites are #2 Gin and Juice, #3 Nojito, #6 Kitchen Sink, #10 OMGinger. I am happy with the change in the recipe, please keep it. I did not like the original O-M-Ginger that I tried. But I like the new one! #11 Sweet Greens, #12 Snoop Dog, #15 Coco Crack (lloooooooveeee), #16 Green Party. #18, 19, and 20 are nut milks and are delicious! They do have added maple syrup which I was disappointed to see. I think the juice would be great without it. I no longer will buy those since they have added sugar. The owner told me the sugar in it is minimal, but I just think why add sugar to something that is supposed to be healthy. Unfortunately, I have it in my head that I am drinking sugar and can't get over it. I really love those drinks and wish they would stop adding that maple syrup to it and I will gladly buy it again. So if you are watching your sugar, beware of the added maple syrup. Thank you to the owner for standing by your products and allowing me to do a return. I really appreciate you backing up your juice and treating customers well. Please consider removing the maple syrup and I will be the first to come try it and give you my honest opinion of the taste. 

I like their packaging, simple way of identifying drinks with a number system #1, 2, 3, etc. I like the glass bottles they come in, easy to drink out of. I like their happy hour specials 10% off during the last 2 hours of the day (but beware that they run out of the most popular juices by then often times), great customer service.

I was in the area pet sitting and was craving a salad & juice then remembered this place was down the street so I said you know what why not splurge and see if they've improved since the last time I was in.

Both the associates were friendly but one of them complained when I ordered a ""Vegan Cesar Salad"" which when I read the menu online just sounded delicious and I was willing to pay the big bucks for a freshly made salad with as I read their menu online states ""ROMAINE, AVOCADO, VEGAN PARMESAN, CASHEW CREAM, LEMON, BLACK PEPPER, SEA SALT, GARLIC, PUMPKIN SEEDS."" Sounds delicious right? Well apparently this associate had already ""made it for himself to have for lunch"" and asked me if I was sure if I ""really wanted it"" so I said ""yes, I want the vegan salad, it sounds delicious and then I want a great juice to go with it as I haven't been feeling well lately and I'm just trying to be more health conscious.""

That's when both associates were really nice and let me try maybe 5-8 different juices and mylks which for that I will give them credit for and I did leave them a tip for the time they spent helping me pick one out. Finally they sold me on the #4 but...when I got to my destination I open up the salad to find only romaine, avocado, cashew cream and vegan parmesan. Where was the lemon, pepper, sea salt, garlic and pumpkin seeds? And it made me think...if this salad was for you, why didn't you just make me a new one or say ""I'm sorry we are all out"". The fact that you gave me ""your salad"" and it was missing items from the menu is just odd....very odd for a $10 salad.

Now for the juice, I got #1, #2, #6, #10, #16 and #20. Price isn't bad, around $10 per juice, though it was the first juice place that charged sales taxes (for me at least). I have been to many pressed juice places and this place's juices are definitely sweeter than what I am used to. People might love this place for this exact reason, but I don't. #1 is the only juice I think is ok, but it's really too mild, they really need another mix with more of a kick and all greens. All the other juices I tried are just so so, too much fruit juices in the mix for me, way too sweet overall.

Da Products: 5/5 this place must use the best ingredients that money can buy because every time we get anything from here it is always so ONO. Getting an Acai bowl is always a gamble everywhere else; sometimes it is still too frozen, sometimes it is too watery, and sometimes it is just clumpy. For as long as I have been going here the consistency is always excellent. The juices here are also super bomb! I like the different combos they have to offer, great selection.

Da Customer Service: 5/5 every time I have gone in I am always greeted with smiles and hellos. The workers here genuinely take time to say hi to everybody and make you feel like they are happy to see you. When I first started coming here I use to ask a thousand and one questions and I never felt like I was a bother to them, and that to me is super cool.

Da Price: 4/5 Some of the items and drinks are little on the higher end compared to the rest of similar shops around the Valley, They also do not offer a military discount, they do have a stamp card option that is hooked up to your phone number, that is a plus.

Da Location: 4/5 Not really central and kinda out of the way, they make up for it with the quality of food they offer here and their customer service, it is always worth the trek. 

Da Good: Excellent food that is always consistent on their taste and quality. The staff here love working here and it shows.

Da Bad: No Military discount and prices are kinda steep...

Da Ugly: Location is kinda far, I'm kinda reaching here!!!

Today, I tried the nitro cold brew & it was really delicious. She also gave me a little sample of the edamame hummus and it was the best hummus I've ever tasted! Apparently, they used to sell the tubs of the hummus but not many customers would purchase them, so they got pulled from the shelf. On the bright side, you can order them in the little veggie boxes that they sell! 

They have some pretty neat juice cleanses, for when you really need that pick me up! Also, make sure to come between 6-8 for 10% off.

Best juice highlights: Local Hottie (honey, cayenne, cinnamon), Threesome (orange/grape/strawberry), Green Milk (superfood green juice/nut milk blend), Bloody Beetroots (probably the best beet juice I've tried, spicy and tasty).

I was greeted right away and when I told them that I had never been here before and that I knew nothing about cold pressed juices.... He told me that I could have a sit at the bar and he would let me try some. So I said sure!! :)

I sat and he basically gave me a tasting of all their juices. He stated of with the Greens and went until he finished with all the nut milks.... Service (5/5)

Now I can say that I've tried every single juice that they make. They were all amazing!!  Some of them were not my favs... But they were all decent and well balanced.... And some were surprisingly delicious!! And if u know someone that is not into healthy drinks... Bring them here... They can try some of the juices and they'll never know it's healthy for them! Lol ;P flavor (5/5)

Ambiance (5/5)... It's very clean and bright here. The stools at the bar were very comfy as well. :)

Prices... That's the only thing that is not a 5 for me. They were kind of expensive as the juices range from 8.95 to 10.95 for a 16 fluid oz bottle.  And the acai bowls are about the same. 

But having said that I have to say that the quality is top notch. 
And I can tell they have alot of pride in what they offer. And they are very knowledgeable about what they offer.  If u are not sure... Ask and they can totally help you figure out what u want. :)

Lately their customer service has been lacking. New employees are easily overwhelmed with big orders especially the bowls and the smoothies. I recently went in and bought a 16oz shake with protein which is $1.50 extra (I think?) and I watched the the guy put all the ingredients for a shake into the blender but leave out the protein and then I finally asked if he had added protein in there he immediately apologized and stopped blending to add the protein. This incident happened and I forgot all about it until I went in on Friday and bought my shake and another juice making my total $24.23 and I handed the clerk $40.23 (making my change $16) He proceeds to hand me a dollar and I had to remind him that I gave him $40 and he actually told me I handed him $25 (which still doesn't make my change $1) Anyway he figures out his error and then doesn't know how much change to give back. He actually asks me him to help him with the math. I helped him I told him he owed me $16 he doesn't believe me and pulls up a calculator anyway and finally gives me my change back. Right before this whole thing happened he rang me up too quickly before I could give him my phone number for my loyalty points (10th juice free) he takes down my phone number and tells me he'll text his boss to get me my points. I was a little annoyed by the whole transaction. I just feel like if I'm going to spend that much money on a shake and a bottle of juice the employees can at least know how to do their job. I understand people can be demanding and being new doesn't help in this case I think the owner needs to spend more time training and addressing issues.,2016-07-18 22:40:22

The Bad;  i've been going there for a while and I'm OK paying $20 for a protein shake but now they stopped giving you the extra. My shake is a little big after you add the protein and stuff and they always gave me the little shot glass of the extra on the side the last three times I've been there they haven't been doing that it's pretty annoying when you pay $20 + tip for a shake and they save what you paid for already for themselves later.

Upon entering, the decor is super cute. Rustic was the term my friend described the furnishing to be. Every table had a cute succulent or plant of some sort. 

How they set up their samples is so simple & cute! They placed a small, ceramic cup (looks like a shot glass) on a wooden block and I chose all of the nut milks that I wanted to try. They were all super tastey! 

Conveniently enough, this place also offers ACAI bowls and shakes in addition to their wide variety of juices and nut milks. I only wish they also offered Pitaya/Dragonfruit for their bowls as I do favor that more than Acai. I tried the PB&A bowl, size small. 

They have a juice cleanse too that looks very interesting to try! Quite pricey though, so maybe one day and I'll work up the nerve (& the money) to give it a try.

Curious if they have stamp cards? Have no fear! For every 10 items you purchase (juices, bowls, smoothies) you get a free juice! They save your cellphone number and your ""stamps"" are kept there. I was also informed that they have a happy hour during the last two hours of their business day; all items are 10% off! If you need to know their business hours, they're open everyday Mon-Fri 6:30am-8pm Sat 8am-7pm Sun 9am-6pm.

She asked for the discount and the girl working there said that she couldn't have it. She also said that it wasn't possible to give the discount, that everything was already set up in the system. From previous visits I know that this is not the case. So #1, they wouldn't do a tiny little thing for what I'm certain is one of their best customers. And #2, lie about your ability to do so.

I love the juice called the Threesome (it's three fruits, hence the name).

This juices are AWESOME, the price of most juices are a little cheaper then the others in town and they have a loyalty program, you give them your phone number and work your way to a free juice.

BUT----reason for 4 rather than 5 stars----I'm incredulous Pressed for Juice doesn't re-use their expensive, well-made bottles.  Instead they indicate they ""Recycle""? I'm sure they know (they've got to know this) the environmentally responsible standard is: (1) reduce, (2) re-use, and, only then, if you can't do either of those two, (3) recycle. It's unfathomable, and seemingly out of step with your principles, that you don't re-use. So many other organic juice and milk businesses around the country find a way to do this.  And---there's a small incentive for returning them.  Even if there were no deposit or incentive, I would still return the bottles. Why do I want a collection of bottles---or to recycle them, or have you recycle them?  I honestly patronize Pressed for Juice 1/3 of what I would if I knew these bottles weren't going to waste---all the energy spent in destroying them via the recycling process and what goes into making all those new bottles.

Well, as sweet as the juice ""barista"" was I'm highly disappointed and most likely won't be back.

After remembering seeing a photo of their acai bowl I decided to give that a try for $11.84! Now maybe I really am cheap but I didn't realise it was just an acai smoothie in a bowl with fruit and granola (and coconut except I'm allergic) but that was not worth $12 to me especially when I didn't have a straw!

We love juice places and in Las Vegas, a good juice place is hard to find.  Yes, there are a few places which have cold pressed juice in bottles, but a lot of the juices over lap ingredients.  

We have found a few great places in California and many times wished someone would open a place in Vegas that will make some GREAT fresh Organic juice at a decent price.  HERE IS IT FINALLY!!!!

We walk in the door and the ambiance of the place is AWESOME unlike any other place in town.   They have seats at the bar and a few other seats around.  Matt greeted us, he is friendly and very knowledgeable.  They have 17 different juices and 3 milks and my favorite part of this place compared to all the others in town, you have a HUGE selection of juices without ginger.  The point is the juices here are unique in their own way and taste great.

It's like someone from California finally came to Vegas and brought an AMAZING juice place with them.  You can sit at the bar, if your first time here, they give you a very cute little wooden board and a real mini cup, not plastic, and you can sample all 20 if you desire.  There are HUGE signs as well as a small card which lists all the ingredients and prices in clear view, there are no hidden costs here.

This juices are AWESOME, the price of most juices are a little cheaper then the others in town and they have a loyalty program, you give them your phone number and work your way to a free juice.  

This place is worth the drive until they open another one closer to the Green Valley area.  Needless to say we left with 8 bottles and will be back.

On my first visit, Iris was behind the counter and she gave me an amazing experience, letting me try every juice I was interested in and showing me some she thought I might like based on my description. It's literally a juice ""bar"", you walk in and can sit on a high top at a bar countertop and sample all of the juices on the menu in a cool little shot glass, awesome concept. I ended up getting the O-M-Ginger and The Kitchen Sink.

O-M-Ginger: when they say ""extra ginger"", they're not kidding. This one has extra ginger, fresh squeezed lemon, and apple. Very very strong but cleaned me out and made me get over the sickness I felt coming on better than any medicine would have.

The kitchen sink: I really really enjoyed this one. Had several different vegetables along with some fruit but this one was awesome. Definitely felt it boost my immune system also.

On my most recent visit, I also checked in on Facebook and posted a picture which earned me a complimentary shot. I got the ""holy shot"" which had cayenne pepper, lemon, ginger, and apple cider vinegar. Oh my god intense. Was harder to take down than I thought but my allergies and sore throat were gone so quick! 

All in all, it's definitely on the pricier side but you get what you pay for. These are real ingredients and real good for you so I think it's worth it. Plus every person I've met that works here is so personable and delivers outstanding customer service. If you're looking to try new flavors or save a couple bucks, they offer 10% off during Happy Hour which is the last 2 hours before closing!

Clean establishment & very friendly service. You can try every single juice on the menu....sort of like going to the bar and taking shots of every kind of liquor but you won't get sloppy and drunk.

Extensive selection of juices with an ingredient list on the bottles. Love the glass bottles that give it a vintage feel. Juices start at about $9 a bottle (16.9 oz - 2 servings).  

Juice cleanse options that take the work out of it. You can buy a day's worth of juice cleanses (6 bottles) for around $59 and they range from beginner to pro.

I sampled the following:

- #4 Local Hottie: liked the light sweet juice with a spicy kick from Cayenne.
- #14 Bloody Beetroots : I'm not a fan of beets because it tastes like dirt to me. This was all beet tasting with a spicy jalape√±o finish.
- #20 Green Milk : this was my favorite. Smooth milky with prominent vanilla bean taste. But read warning below.
- #15 Coco Crack : imagine cracking open a fresh coconut and drinking the contents.

I left the store with my Green Milk and Coco Crack. I wanted my family to try the Coco Crack so I drank my Green Milk. I drank about 3/4 of a bottle on the 25 minute drive home. Thank God it wasn't a minute longer because I couldn't get to the bathroom sooner! The Green Milk went right through me. I don't know if I wasn't supposed to drink nearly the entire bottle but it was so good, I couldn't help myself. I still have 1/4 left in the fridge and a little nervous to finish it.

Each of the places I've tried in Vegas has had at least one major drawback (pricing, selection, service, etc)- until now. Pressed for Juice has it all and then some!

SERVICE: Go in and you'll be offered a juice tasting! Cute tiny cup, little pours of each flavor, the full attention of an employee, actual service! I was attended to by two different ladies, both of whom were genuinely friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. I've literally never had such great service at a juice place!

PRODUCT: With 20+ drinks to choose from, all with clever names (Gin & Juice, Soup Dog, Threesome, Sweetie Pie, etc), an ingredient list, and the purported benefits of the combined fruits and vegetables, there's something for everyone. Three or four different green juices with a range of sweetness, various spicy juices with cayenne and jalapeno, several fruity concoctions, and three different nut milks.

PRICING: Bottled, cold press, non-HPP juice will run you an average of $8-13/bottle in most major cities, Vegas is no exception. Prices here are in the average range but they have several ways to get discounts: Happy Hour is the last 2 hours of every day, and gets you 10% off your order; they run various promotions on FB and Instagram; and you can use a stamp card for a free drink with every 10 bottles purchased!

They serve the flight with a menu that describes each ingredient within the juice shot and align the health benefits with each concoction. 


My Top 4 Favorites : 

Local Hottie: 
Pineapple, Coconut water, Lemon, Local Honey and Cayenne (for a kick)| Improves Circulation, Reduces Allergies and is a Metabolism Booster 

The Kitchen Sink: 
Kale, Orange, Spinach, Cilantro, Carrot, Parsley, Cucumber, Lemon, Celery, Lime, Apple, Mint, Pineapple and a touch of Lava Salt | Nutritional Powerhouse, Antioxidant Rich and Detoxifying 

O-M-Ginger: 
Apple, Lemon and Extra Ginger (it's got a kick) | Strengthens Immune System, Aids in Digestion and is a Metabolism Booster 

Coco Crack: 
Coconut Water and Coconut Meat | Hydration, Blood Pressure Management and Anti-Aging 

During my visit, I learned that they source their organic ingredients from local farms in Las Vegas, Nevada and in Southern California. Their 'juice baristas' were very knowledgeable, perky and willing to answer my gazillion questions. 

My visit here was a treat from a friend for my birthday - my clever friends know me well and suggested this spot over booze filled drinks. This was one unique gift idea and I loved it. I even took a bottle of their Kitchen Sink and O-M-Ginger home for the following days to come. I certainly plan to swing by here and pick up a few bottles again! 

PS: 
They have more than juice here. Stop by for a fruit bowl or a cleanse kit!  They also have happy hour --- see my tip for their discounted hours.

Everything about this juice bar is extremely well thought out. You can tell that they put effort into the design of the store with their modern decor, clever emoji inspired graphics and silly names. Their cold pressed juice blends are comprised of a huge variety of ingredients and are unique and perfectly balanced. They carry a large selection and come up with new interesting juices periodically. There are definitely flavors here that you can't find elsewhere in Vegas and they're never watered down or bland. 

I'm a green juice girl so I rotate regularly between Green Party which has a noticeable green pepper flavor, Sweet Greens which is more acidic with the addition of pineapple, The Kitchen Sink with every ingredient imaginable, and Gin n Juice which has a stronger but not overpowering ginger flavor. I especially like that they don't go too heavy on the turmeric in any of their juices.

Boy am I so happy I did!!!

With the helpfulness of the lovely staff by offering samples, I was able to come to a verdict: The Local Hottie... my NEW FAVORITE DRINK!! The taste of pineapple with a slight hint of coconut... sweetness from honey and tanginess from the lemons... not to mention the kick of cayenne pepper creates such a unique flavor!

I'll just say that I'm willing to bet that everyone will find lots of things that they like and a few that they don't. Good news: there's a tasting bar where you can find out what works for you and what doesn't. (be warned - there's a huge difference between a single sip of these bad boys and drinking a pint. More on that in a minute.)

In-store experience was fantastic. Answered all my questions, great attitude, smiles all around. I wanted to do a 3-day cleanse so I purchased one each of the virgin, amateur, and pro packages. You can also make your own, but I'm a noob. The main difference is that as you move up the scale towards 'pro', you get less fruit, less calories, and more veggies.

Over the three days I lost 5 lbs. (individual results may vary, check local listings for show times) This is likely due to the fact that I had deviated from my usual diet of IPA, wine, whatever the eff I want to eat that sounds good at the moment, and IPA. I was in the bathroom a lot on day one. A LOT. No, A LOT. Day two, hungry. Hangry. Day 3, inexplicably, was a breeze. High energy, never hungry. So weird. It's day 3 that made me a fan of the 'juice cleanse'. But the best day of a 3-day cleanse is, hands down, day 4. Would I do it again? Yes. Right after I finish this bacon sandwich.

All of the nut milk drinks were delicious. Some have more sugar than others, so be careful there. The 'Clay Mate' that they end each day with is by turns tasty, strange, and by the end, difficult to finish. But maybe I don't typically drink as much clay as you do. I do liken the experience to going wine tasting, where everything is delicious in the tasting room and maybe a little underwhelming after you've had the whole bottle back at home.

I dig this place, except for the packaging on the bottles. Labels are attractive, of course, but I have two other issues. #1: the caps on the bottles are virtually impossible to separate from the little plastic ring that's supposed to stay on the bottle. The whole thing comes off (16 out of 18 times in my case). #2, and more important: these guys NEED to recycle. Seriously. I'm sitting here staring at 20 empty glass bottles - and thick, heavy glass at that - on my counter. It seems to me that the right thing to do would be to offer some type of bottle exchange program where you get a small discount on your next purchase (or points in the loyalty program they offer) when you bring your bottles back. An easy way to get folks back in the store that might otherwise not be, by the way. PFJ, when you read this... please. Recycle. It's what any self-respecting hippie juice bar would do.",2015-08-29 21:44:12

I got a tuna sandwich and the bread was old (very hard) not toasted, I went back to the counter and told them I wanted fresh bread for my sandwich, the girl called the owner and he told her to just replace the bread instead of making a new sandwich, can you imagine what a mess was that? I got very frustrated and told the girl to just give me my money back, she had to call the owner again, and when he got told I wanted a refund, he then told her to make my sandwich right from scratch. I'm not coming back to this location again, this is the first time I have an experience like this at a subway store, just tacky!",2018-04-21 21:23:45

I ordered a footlong Black Forest Ham with sides and got my order correct. The service was alright, long line though, but they need to hire more employees. When I ate the sandwich, it was very delicious and was very happy. Would definitely come back to try other subs.",2014-03-23 08:17:41
